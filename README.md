This an example to do RooSimultaneousFit using RooFit in ROOT. It requires the reconstructed data "geqfrun4p.root" to run. 

The idea of Simultaneous Fit is to constrain one common fitting parameter between multiple fits. In this case, the program is trying to fit the recoil energy spectra from different scattering detectors, and try to constrain the energy spread as a sharing fitting parameter.

To run this, simply run it as a ROOT macro.
